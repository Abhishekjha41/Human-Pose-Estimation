# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning

## ðŸ•º Human Pose Estimator 


An interactive web application for estimating human poses in images using OpenCV's and MediaPipe's deep learning model

---

## Features

- **Upload Image**: Allows users to upload their own image for pose estimation.
- **Customizable Threshold**: Set the detection confidence threshold using a slider.
- **Real-time Pose Estimation**: Detects key body joints and visualizes connections between them.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
